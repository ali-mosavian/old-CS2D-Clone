Counter-Strike 2D server info request 
Do you want to write your own client to request Counter-Strike 2D server informations?
I'll tell you what you have to do:
1. You can load a list off all servers on the U.S.G.N. from here: http://www.cs2d.com/usgn/games/Counter-Strike%202D.txt
2. If you have an IP you have to use the UDP protocol to request informations:

Send this to the server:
250 (Byte)
0 (Byte)

3. Now you have to wait until the server replies:

The server will reply this:
250 (Byte) 
1 (Byte)
Server Name (Line)
Password (Byte, 1 - password / 0 - no password)
Map (Line)
Players (Byte)
Max Players (Byte)
Fog of War (Byte, 1 fog of war / 0 - no fog of war)
War Mode (Byte, 1 war mode / 0 - no war mode) 

That's all.
